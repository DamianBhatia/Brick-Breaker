# Brick-Breaker
The project that I recently worked on was making Brick Breaker in Java. The game consists of a paddle that is controlled by the player and bricks in the middle of the screen that must all be broken to move onto the next level. I worked on this project to get more familiar with Java's graphics libraries and the process behind designing game logic.
